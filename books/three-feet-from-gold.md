# Three Feet from Gold

Most successful people are the most accessible people.
The most successful people want to teach others how to become successful.

Those in the middle, struggling to find their own voice and create their identity, in a hyper-competitive atmosphere who have no time to help anyone else. They are controlled by their ego, wealth and fancy title. They haven't discovered who they are, yet.

"NO" is the second best answer. At least, you know where you stand.

I can do it, I will do it, I am doing it.
If people don't critize you, you are not doing enough.

Be a Job Maker, not a Job Taker.
