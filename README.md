## Development

Currently powered by Jekyll. When something simpler, comes along, it will likely be swapped. Any tooling should be easily swappable while the content remains intact. May need a bit of parsing of the Markdown/Text files but they should be simple and should not contain any markups that is akin to any processor.

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```
