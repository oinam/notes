# The Great Gatsby

[The Great Gatsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby) is a 1925 novel by Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, the novel depicts narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.

The book is short. The book can be finished in a day or two. Otherwise, all the mystery seeps away, leaving Jay Gatsby lingering, ethereal but elusive, like cologne somebody else is wearing.
