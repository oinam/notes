# Competition, Marketing

Unless you’ve invented something no one has ever seen before, you probably have competition. And even if your product is absolutely unique, your audience might have other things to spend their money on. In this section, you’ll talk about your competitors and figure out what they’re doing and what your advantage is.

For a formal analysis, you’ll want to look at a few different types of competition:

Direct competitors. Direct competitors are companies that do the same thing you do, for the same target audience, in the same way. For many business owners, this is likely who you think of when you think of the competition. They’re in the same business, sell similar or identical products, operate where you do, and can seem interchangeable to your customers.
Indirect competitors. Indirect competitors share some but not all of the characteristics of your business. They may target the same customers as you, with the same product, but operate in a different geographic area. Or they may have the same customers and operate in the same location but sell a slightly different product.

Tertiary or peripheral competitors. These are companies that don’t sell the same product or service as you, but otherwise compete for your target audience’s money. Remember that most customers have a limited discretionary budget. If they spend it elsewhere, even if it’s not on products similar to yours, it’s still less money that they have to spend on your products or services.

Potential competitors. These businesses don’t exist yet, but they could change the way your industry operates. A great example is how Uber began competing with taxi companies. It was an entirely new business model that worked in a radically new way, and it provided a service that replaced some of the need for taxis.

Narrowing down your direct competitors is a little bit more challenging but not much more if you think strategically. A good rule is to think in groups of four: biggest, best, closest, and catching up.

Biggest is the easiest one to figure out. Who is the market leader or the biggest competitor you have?
Best is more subjective. Who do you think is the best, coolest, most talked about, or most envied of your competitors?
Closest is typically the second easiest to figure out. Which of your competitors do you feel is the closest in terms of size, price, customers, etc.?
Catching up is smaller than you but gaining ground. Which of your smaller competitors is closest to catching up with you? Note, if you’re starting a new business, instead of catching up to you, consider which newcomer to the industry has gained the most ground the quickest.
