# Cooking

Learn to cook. You will be independent when it comes to the most important thing in life - living. Of course, you get the added benefit of being healthy.

The most important lesson I learnt was not of being able to follow recipe but have an guestimate ideas of how much of either salt, sugar, or spices to add to a dish. Once you have an idea, all cooking are just permutation and combinations with just syntactic sugar (or salt or spices) changes.
