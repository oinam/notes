# Apple

[Apple](https://www.apple.com) has a closely knit computing ecosystem. We leverage the ecosystem to get things done easier, and seamlessly.

We try to stay with the default native apps and programs that comes with the OSes as much as possible. However, you still need few must-have tools, utilities, and programs that you need to get things done.

We also try to backups of our content in non-Apple accessible formats to be able to move and decouple smoothly, if needed.

Besides many others, here are some of the key non-apple applications that we use on a regular basis;

- [1Password](https://1password.com)\
