# Parties

Here are a few ideas to make it easier when you host a party.

1. Take it easy. Try to make it a common event, if you are stressed while thinking, planning, and hosting, it will be harder and you will be more stressed.
2. Invite them early. If the party is at 7PM, say that the party starts at 6:30PM — they will turn up at 7PM.
3. Start with a few close friends earlier. Warm up the parties about 30-60 minutes early with known people and let it flow in when the official time arrives.
4. Not all Strangers. Parties are best when some of them knows some of them. Try namedropping common friends to let them know that they are never going to be strangers.
5. If you can, co-host the parties. Perhaps even with someone whom you are not yet deep friends. You get to invite people from both sides of the hosts.
6. While leaving a conversation in a group talk, there is no need to announce and make it an event. It is better to step back and stepping away.
7. Learn to introduce people and talk about them. It is always about the other peson, not you.
8. Always send them reminders. People forget, don’t schedule, and will flake. Reminders also reminds them that they are important.
