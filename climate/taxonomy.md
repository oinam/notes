# Taxonomy

Climate Change (erstwhile popularly known as global warming) is the increase in global average temperature and its effects on Earth’s climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.

In my effort to help fight Climate Change, I came across a lot of term and definition that I had to learn along the way. Here is my effort to record the terms and taxonomy of Climate Change.

## 0-9
## A

- ABACUS from Amazon is a Verified Carbon Unit (VCU), which goes above and beyond [Verra](https://verra.org)’s methodology and will focus on ensuring additionality, leakage, and durability standards in the market. That group comprises Amazon research scientists and experts at the University of California Berkeley, The Nature Conservancy, and other organizations. The new carbon credit label will focus on two project types – agroforestry and reforestation. 
## B

- Biomass Carbon Removal and Storage (BiCRS) is a process that removes CO₂ from the air through biomass and stores it.

- [Global Warming Potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential) (GWP) is the heat absorbed by any greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, as a multiple of the heat that would be absorbed by the same mass of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). GWP is 1 for CO<sub>2</sub>. For other gases it depends on the gas and the time frame. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e or CO<sub>2</sub>eq or CO<sub>2</sub>-e) is calculated from GWP. For any gas, it is the mass of CO<sub>2</sub> that would warm the earth as much as the mass of that gas. Thus it provides a common scale for measuring the climate effects of different gases. It is calculated as GWP times mass of the other gas.
	- A more commonly used term is __tCO<sub>2</sub>e__ defined as the “Tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent”. It is a measure for describing how much global warming a given type and amount of greenhouse gas may cause, using the functionally equivalent amount or concentration of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) as the reference. For example, methane is a greenhouse gas that has a stronger effect on climate change than CO<sub>2</sub>. To be able to compare it with the effect of CO<sub>2</sub>, it is converted into CO<sub>2</sub>e. Like this, it is possible to say that that 1t of methane has the same effect on climate change as 25t of CO<sub>2</sub>.
