# Shu-Ha-Ri 守破離

[Shu-Ha-Ri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari) is a Japanese martial art concept which describes the stages of learning to mastery. It can be generously applied to other disciplines.

Shu - Follow the Rules
Ha - Break the Rules
Ri - Make the Rules

## Shu

We repeat the forms and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created. We remain faithful to these norms with no deviation.

## Ha

Once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. In this process the forms maybe broken and discarded.

## Ri

We completely depart from the forms, open the door to creative technique, and arrive in a plae where we act in accordance with what our heart and mind desires, unhindered while not overstepping laws.
