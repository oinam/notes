# The Upside of Stress

Think about what stress really is: a reaction that occurs when something you care about is at stake. This could be your frustration over a traffic jam or your grief over the loss of a loved one.

Think of a time in your life that led to positive changes, a newfound purpose or significant personal growth. It’s not unlikely that these times followed periods that were very stressful. That’s the paradox of stress! Although it’s frustrating, the paradox of stress makes a lot of sense, too.

Despite what you may have thought, stress isn’t always bad for you. If you approach stressful experiences as something you can learn from, then you certainly will. Even our biological responses to stress allow us to deepen relationships, boost our confidence and increase our resilience.
