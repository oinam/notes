# Markdown

> [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax, created in 2004 by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net) with [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).

- [Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) is a technology for writing plain text documents that will look good in any web browser, whether local or remote. It supports diagrams, calendars, equations, and other features as extensions of Markdown syntax.
- [TeXMe](https://github.com/susam/texme) is a lightweight JavaScript utility to create self-rendering Markdown + LaTeX documents.
