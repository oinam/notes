The Masters do what needs doing and that's all they do.
Do what you have to do without arrogance or pride.
Get the job done and don't brag about it afterwards.
Do what you have to do, not for your own benefit, but because it needs to be done.
And don't do it the way you think it should be done, do it the way it needs to be done.

â€” Tao Te Ching
