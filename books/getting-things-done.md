# Getting Things Done


[Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) (GTD) is a personal productivity system developed by [David Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author)). GTD is described as a time management system.

The GTD method rests on the idea of moving all items of interest, relevant information, issues, tasks and projects out of one's mind by recording them externally and then breaking them into actionable work items with known time limits. This allows one's attention to focus on taking action on each task listed in an external record, instead of recalling them intuitively.
