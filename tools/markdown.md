# Markdown

> [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax, created in 2004 by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net) with [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).
> 
> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) by John Gruber where it all started.
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) is a free and open-source reference guide that explains how to use Markdown, the simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format virtually any document.
- [TeXMe](https://github.com/susam/texme) is a lightweight JavaScript utility to create self-rendering Markdown + [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) documents.
- [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) turn your analyses into high quality documents, reports, presentations and dashboards.
- [MarkDeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) is a technology for writing plain text documents that will look good in any web browser, whether local or remote. It supports diagrams, calendars, equations, and other features as extensions of Markdown syntax.
