# Chess

[Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king.

“Assume the Opponent’s Best Moves; Stop playing Hope Chess.“

Hope Chess is when you make a move and don't look at what your opponent might threaten on their next move, and whether you can meet that threat on your next move. Instead, you just wait until next move and see what they do, and then hope you can meet any threats.
