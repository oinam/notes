> Articles, writings I found on the Web that are worth a thorough reading.

- [Seeking Advice in Startups](https://nuances.substack.com/p/seeking-advice-in-startups) is a simple article yet powerful advice. If you have the option or luxury of picking advisors, then find Expert Advisors with a reflective method.
- [Solitude and Leadership](https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/); if you want others to follow, learn to be alone with your thoughts.
- [The Most Precious Resource is Agency](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency). Most people live their lives never questioning the scripts that are given to them. Gaining agency is gaining the capacity to do something differently from, or in addition to, the events that simply happen to you.
