# Go Bag (Bug-out Bag)

A [bug-out bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug-out_bag) (BOB) or in a more common term, *Go Bag* is a portable kit that normally contains the items one would require to survive for 72 hours when evacuating from a disaster, although some kits are designed to last longer periods. Other names for such a bag are a 72-hour kit, battle box, grab bag, GOOD bag (get out of dodge), personal emergency relocation kit (PERK), or quick run bag (QRB).

The focus is on evacuation, rather than long-term survival, distinguishing the Go Bag from a survival kit, an aviation or a boating emergency kit, or a fixed-site disaster supplies kit.
