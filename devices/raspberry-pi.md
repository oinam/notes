# Raspberry Pi

> The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) Foundation. It is widely used in many areas, such as for weather monitoring, etc. because of its low cost and high portability.

A Raspberry Pi can [boot from the Network](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md).

- [Twister OS](https://twisteros.com/) is built on the official Raspbian Pi OS with themes designed to appear like operating systems they are themed after, but they are no operating systems by themselves.
