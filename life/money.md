Anyone promising you fast and/or high yield beyond the current market is trying to take you on a [Ponzi Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme). [High-Yield Investment Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-yield_investment_program) (HYIP) is an investment scam that promises unsustainably high return on investment by paying previous investors with the money invested by new investors.
