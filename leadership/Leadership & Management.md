# Leadership & Management

“Play chess not checkers”.
Great managers are like great chess masters. Each person has unique abilities, skill set, strengths and limitations. They know their people and position them to draw the best out of everyone. Allow your people to discover their own identity and assign them roles and/or responsibilities where their unique set of skills would best be put to use.

I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. — Maya Angelou

“The currency of real networking is not greed but generosity.”

“Hire for attitude, train for skills”
“When looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if you don’t have the first, the other two will kill you. You think about it; it’s true. ~Warren Buffet
