# macOS Apps

We try to stay with the default Apps that comes with macOS. However, you still need few must-have tools, utilities, and programs that you need to get things done. Beside the usual heavyweights such as the browsers, here are some of the interesting and pretty useful macOS Apps that we use regularly.
