[Apple](https://www.apple.com) has one of the best Computing Ecosystem. We leverage the ecosystem to get things done easier, smarter, and seamlessly.

We try to stay with the defaults that comes with the OSes as much as possible. However, you still need few must-have tools, utilities, and programs that you need to get things done.

Here are some of the interesting and pretty useful applications that we use regularly.
