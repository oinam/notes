# Internet

The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global.

The World Wide Web or just the `Web`, is an information system enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet.

As of 2023, the web is becoming increasingly life-like but life-less state of being online. Most open and publicly available spaces on the web are overrun with bots, advertisers, trolls, data scrapers, clickbait, keyword-stuffing “content creators,” and algorithmically manipulated junk.

There is an explosion of noise that will drown out any signal making it extremely hard to find human insights or authentic connections.
