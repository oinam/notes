# Leonardo da Vinci

Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo's notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, [Walter Isaacson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson) weaves a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo's genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy.

Leonardo da Vinci produced the two most famous paintings in history -- The [Last Supper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Supper) and the [Mona Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa). But in his own mind, he was just as much a man of science and technology. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of [Vitruvian Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man), made him history's most creative genius.

Leonardo's genius was of the type we can understand, even take lessons from.
