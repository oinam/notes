# Apple Ecosystem

[Apple](https://www.apple.com) has a closely knit computing ecosystem. We leverage the ecosystem to get things done easier, smarter, and seamlessly.

We try to stay with the default native apps and programs that comes with the OSes as much as possible. However, you still need few must-have tools, utilities, and programs that you need to get things done.

Here are some of the non-apple applications that we use.

- [1Password](https://1password.com). At the start of the 21st century, we started with [Keepass](https://keepass.info) as the entry into the world of Password Management but moved to 1Password (2006) since its beta and haven't looked back.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) with its PowerPack is the primary utility that drives the regular task that happens on the MacOS. If you do have PowerPack, look into its [WorkFlows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/).
- [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com)
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
- [ExpanDrive](https://www.expandrive.com) (life-time upgrades)
- [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com) + [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com) + [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)
- [MindNode](https://mindnode.com)
- [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/?from=at8wqcps)

## Evaluating (as of 2020)

- [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com)
- [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com)
- [Objecttive See](https://objective-see.com/) Products
  + [Lulu](https://objective-see.com/products/lulu.html) is a free, open-source firewall that aims to block unknown outgoing connections.

### Icebox

- [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/) is a really good firewall but is proving to be a bit of an overkill.
- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com), then [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) but finally gave up those tiny little pleasures of having windows at the precise locations, size, and what not.
