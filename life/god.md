# God

If indeed the divine crafted our Earth, the vast expanse of the universe, and all its inhabitants, it would seem that such God(s) have departed long ago.

We find ourselves isolated in this minuscule fragment of the ever-expanding cosmos. The divine, distant from us, is now shaping and exploring other forms.

Yet, amidst this vastness, the principles of peace and love propel humanity forward, acting as guiding lights in our journey. Our existence and the interpretation of our lives lie solely in our hands. As evolved or evolving beings, it is incumbent upon us to select a path that benefits both the animate and inanimate entities that share this remarkable abode we call home.

Embracing love and peace ensures our progress and the harmonious advancement of all.
