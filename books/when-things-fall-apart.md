# When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chödrön

Embracing your fears is your ticket to greater self-knowledge.

Loneliness is the perfect opportunity for self-observation and self-love.

By accepting these endings as part of the constantly changing flow of life, we can accept that nothing is permanent – not even our existence. In this way, death becomes nothing to be feared.

Celebrating impermanence, suffering and egolessness brings us closer to the meaning of life.

There’s no pleasure without pain; likewise, there’s no inspiration without wretchedness.

Being compassionate toward others allows us to love ourselves more deeply.

Meditation, breathing and a new perspective on the world can carry us through difficult times.

By incorporating self-acceptance, calm reflection and a deeper appreciation for the present moment into your day-to-day life, you’ll be better equipped to confront challenging times. Taking the time to learn about your fears, flaws and difficulties, while embracing even the most unpleasant parts of life, can also bring you closer to friends and family – and strangers too.
