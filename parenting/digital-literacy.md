## Touch Typing

Touch Typing is one of those neglected skills, especially with the popularity of mobile and touch-screen devices. However, one such skill becomes more and more valuable as the kids progress. Teach your kid to touch type -- the skill of typing on the keyboard without looking at the keyboard.

It is OK to stay with the worldâ€˜s generic default QWERTY[^QWERTY] and not necessarily force someone to DVORAK[^DVORAK], as suggested by a few typing enthusiasts.

_Here are few tools, Apps, and methodologies to learn to touch-type._

[^QWERTY]: [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) is a keyboard layout for Latin-script alphabets. The name comes from the order of the first six keys on the top left letter row of the keyboard -- `QWERTY`. The QWERTY design is based on a layout created for the Sholes and Glidden typewriter and sold to E. Remington and Sons in 1873. It became popular with the success of the Remington No. 2 of 1878, and remains in ubiquitous use.

[^DVORAK]: [DVORAK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) is a keyboard layout for English patented in 1936 by August Dvorak and his brother-in-law, William Dealey, as a faster and more ergonomic alternative to the QWERTY layout (the `de facto` standard keyboard layout). Dvorak proponents claim that it requires less finger motion and as a result reduces errors, increases typing speed, reduces repetitive strain injuries, or is simply more comfortable than QWERTY.
