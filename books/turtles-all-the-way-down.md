# Turtles All the Way Down

[Turtles All the Way Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_All_the_Way_Down_(novel)) is a young adult novel written by [John Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Green_(author)).

The story is about a 16-year-old Aza Holmes, an American high school student with OCD and anxiety, and her search for a fugitive billionaire. She is grieving the loss of her father while a budding relationship grows between her and a neighbor.

Aza is usually accompanied by two close friends: Mychal Turner, an aspiring artist, and her best friend Daisy Ramirez, who writes Star Wars fan fiction.

One day at school, Daisy discovers that Russell Pickett, a billionaire construction magnate and the father of one of Aza's old friends, Davis Pickett, has gone missing in the wake of fraud investigations. Tempted by the reward of $100,000 for information leading to Pickett's arrest, Daisy takes Aza on a search for the missing billionaire. After canoeing across the White River and sneaking onto the Pickett property, they are caught by the security guard who brings them to meet Davis.

In an attempt to persuade the two girls to stop pursuing the elder Pickett, Davis gives Aza $100,000 taken from his father's various stashes around the guest house, which she splits with Daisy. After the meeting, Davis and Aza begin dating, and, at the same time, Daisy becomes romantically involved with Mychal. As time passes, Aza believes that she cannot overcome her anxiety, preventing her from ever having a normal relationship with Davis. She finds numerous blog posts written by him about his feelings on his father's disappearance and relationship with her.

Aza reads Daisy's fan fiction for the first time and discovers that Daisy has been using it as a vent for her frustrations with Aza. Their friendship briefly deteriorates, culminating in a heated argument while Aza drives that result in a car accident. Aza spends several weeks in the hospital, during which she has an anxiety attack and passes out after drinking hand sanitizer. She recovers and rekindles her friendship with Daisy once she is healed.

While attending an underground art exhibition, Aza and Daisy finally solve the mystery and realize that Pickett had run to the very place they were. After noticing putrefaction emanating from the area, they suspect that the billionaire had already died. Aza tells Davis of their discovery, and the latter eventually places an anonymous tip to the police, who find the body.

Well, Davis's father had left his entire fortune to his pet tuatara. Davis and Noah decide to relocate to Colorado, where they have rented a house and attend schools. As Davis and Aza say their goodbyes, she reflects on the open possibilities of her future.
