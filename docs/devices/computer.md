# Computer

Your default/main computer (laptop) is a MacBook Pro. The reason for a MacBook Pro is the MicroSD card slot that is set up as a Time Machine Backup.

Remember to check regularly, at least monthly, if the Backup Works. Open Time Machine and if some of the latest works such as documents, drawings, etc are replicated there.

## Backup

Your computer settings and preferences are saved and backup on Apple’s iCloud. So, all your work, photos, documents, sketches, etc are synced. The Time Machine backup is your local copy for easy access and versions of your work.

## External Drives

Flash drives, Pen drive, or any external drive can fail anytime. There is no guarantee.

## Repairs

If you have to take the device for repairs, it is OK to show this article to the Repair-person.

- If you can, change the password to something simple before any repairs. Change it back when the computer is repaired and back to normal.
- Make sure that they know about the backup **MicroSD Card** that is stuck to the computer. It can be taken out. You need to retain that if you had to keep the computer for repairs or getting it replaced. Anyways, if a replacement is involved, I’m likely to get involved.
