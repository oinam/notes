# The Art of War

The Art of War  by Sun Tzu


25,000 years ago, Sun Tzu wrote this classic book of military strategy based on Chinese warfare and military thought. Since that time, all levels of military have used the teaching on Sun Tzu to warfare and civilization have adapted these teachings for use in politics, business and everyday life. The Art of War is a book which should be used to gain advantage of opponents in the boardroom and battlefield alike.

This book is very hard to read, with much of it very hard to make it relevant to today. I know a lot of people swear by the book. That is OK. This is good for a one-time read and grab what you can and let go.
