Visit the [Oinam Digital Garden](https://oinam.fyi/) for details. The [Source](https://github.com/oinam/oinam.fyi) is hosted on Github.

## Development

Currently powered by Jekyll. When something simpler, comes along, any tooling should be easily swappable while the content remains intact. May need few parsing of the Markdown/Text files but they should be simple and should not contain any markups that is akin to any processor.

```
$ bundler
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
