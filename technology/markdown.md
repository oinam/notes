# Markdown

> [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax, created in 2004 by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net) with [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).
> 
> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
