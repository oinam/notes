# Goals and Objectives, Marketing

Setting goals and objectives for your marketing plan is critical. Without them, you won’t be able to properly evaluate your strategy, and you won’t be able to tell if something is working.

Goals. Goals are things your whole business or organization wants to accomplish over a long timeframe. Goals are typically broader and less specific than other targets and have longer timelines to completion.
Objectives. Objectives are things that individual departments want to accomplish to help achieve organizational goals. They are much narrower and more specific than goals and are generally accomplished in the medium term.
Targets. Target is a broad term that can contain goals, objectives, or smaller units down to the individual employee. A target is just a specific thing that you want someone to achieve.

## SMART

Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely.
