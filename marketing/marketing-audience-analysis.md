# Audience Analysis, Marketing

Who are your customers? No marketing plan would be complete without a look at who you want to sell to. You should answer questions not just about who your customers are but what their motivations are and how you can reach them.

## How do you define your target audience?

Is my audience big enough to support my business, or do I need to expand it?
Can this audience afford to buy from me?
Are there easy ways to engage with my audience, or will it be too difficult to reach them?
Are there any other target audiences that I may not be reaching now but that I think I can reach?
Can I convince my audience that they should purchase from my business?
Is there room in this audience for a new competitor?
