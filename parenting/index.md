# Parenting

> Exceptional people grow up in exceptional milieus.

- Simplify your life.
- Get away from noisy situations and circumstances.
- Do what you like and not what the society or market tells you.
- Enjoy what you do and don't force yourself in environments that cause you pain and are toxic for your mental state.
- Keep around genuine friends but remain an acquaintance to others.
- Always think where you were a couple of years ago and where you currently are; it helps you appreciate yourself even more.
- Do not hesitate to ask for help; you never know from where it might come.

**If you want your kids to succeed, you have to let them fail.**

1. Learn to lose well. In life, you lose more than you win. Learning how to take a loss, get back up, and keep moving, makes you resilient.
2. Failure is not glamorous nor inspirational. It hurts. Resilient people feel the pain of losing, which inspires them to keep fighting. Learn to accept the sting of that failure and move on.
3. What is Success? No, it is not the results. We, as parents, support you in full with unconditional love even if your efforts doesn't produce the desired result. School, sports, or at home, we equate success with efforts, not outcomes.
4. Take risk, perhaps calculated risk. Building resilience requires taking risks. Risk-taking is a muscle. Make sure you exercise it from an early age.
5. Try to solve your own problems. Ask parents for something entirely new or things that are dangerous. Solve problems but don't be an idiot.
6. Loving pressure. We will apply loving pressure to push you to do something that you will struggle with but may be achievable. We hate the idea but you and we will love the outcomes that comes out of that practice.
7. Time principles;
	1. Things take time.
	2. Things work out over time.
	3. Time heals. Patience in the face of failure - put you head down, do the work and let the clock tick in your favor.
8. There will be self-doubt -- it is a feature, not a bug. Resilience requires listening to self-doubt. Because self-doubt signals that you're being stretched. 
9. Stack stones. Ancient cultures memorialized big events with stones. They were physical reminders of what they had overcome. Whether it's a journal of big wins, pictures on the wall, or a phrase on the mirror, it is fun to write or draw and document your their strengths, failures, and other events. You will love it in future.
