## Wi-Fi

“Behind every good Wi-Fi network is an excellent wired backbone infrastructure.” — [the Tao of Wi-Fi](/technology/wi-fi/)

This is one of those simple topics that gets serious as one goes deeper. The best would be to ask, “How important is my Internet connectivity in our home?”

If you are OK with moving your device a bit here and there to be within the reasonable range of the Wi-Fi (or the extender), then go ahead and have those wireless extenders and be done with it. Most homes fall in this category.

If you want good connectivity where you are—in the main bedroom’s corner, to the bathroom, to the balcony—get your flat hard-wired once and be done with it. The standard and highly economical CAT6 cables should last at least 20+ years. Fiber should last you another 50+ years, but I’m going to guess that 9 out of 10 of us don’t need it. This becomes important when you play games, your kids complain about jankyness with their games, or you feel that lag when on video calls.

It will cost less than ₹5,000 to do a full wiring of a typical 3BHK.

Note: Wi-Fi Mesh is another fancy (read marketing) term for the same tech that powers extenders, access points, and the like where a main Wi-Fi re-distributes Wi-Fi to your other ‘extending’ devices.
