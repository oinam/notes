- If you try to design something that’s idiot-proof, the universe will design a better idiot.
- Being a designer is being a good communicator first. The rest is applying the gestalt. But it starts with putting yourself in the shoes of the audience and telling a story (visually). This is why, no matter how much technology changes, from Paint shop pro, to Photoshop, to Sketch, to Figma, etc. Nothing scares a designer, because designing is a timeless skills with very few variants over time (gradients / skeuomorphic design / flat / combination ...)

- “You’ve either started a company or you haven’t. ‘Started’ doesn’t mean joining as an early employee, or investing or advising or helping out. It means starting with no money, no help, no one who believes in you, and building an organization from a borrowed cubicle with credit card debt and nowhere to sleep except the office. It almost invariably means being dismissed by arrogant investors who show up a half hour late, totally unprepared and then instead of saying ‘no’ give you non-committal rejections like ‘we invest in later stage companies.’ It means looking prospective employees in the eyes and convincing them to leave safe jobs, quit everything and throw their lot in with you. It means having pundits in the press and blogs who’ve never built anything criticize you and armchair quarterback your every mistake. It means lying awake at night worrying about running out of cash and having a constant knot in your stomach during the day fearing you’ll disappoint the few people who believed in you and validate your smug doubters.”

- There's a general misconception between being productive and being effective. One can fill their days by completing many mindless tasks and consider themselves as productive, but in the end hardly any of those tasks really matters. On the other hand, another person may only complete one or two tasks in a very short time during their day but these were critical tasks that could generate much higher values. This subsequently makes the person more effective than their peers. The output values must be weight in determining if one is really productive. Effectiveness triumphs mindless productivity. This is quite similar to the cognitive and decision fatigue principle which indicates that each of us only has a limited pool of cognitive resources and so we must be very selective in choosing what activities we engage in. To remain highly effective, not just being productive, particularly for a project manager, it's imperative to spend time only on tasks that require critical decisions to be made, and to delegate the rest. When you take on more tasks than you can handle, like some are misunderstanding this may help them appear as productive, it will undoubtedly affect the quality of each of your decisions and the project will suffer.

- The loneliness of being in limbo while waiting for the backend team to finish building what you need.
- The separation of design and construction into phases is a hangover from civil engineering. It has the baked in assumption that the design phase is relatively cheap, short and somewhat unpredictable the construction phase is expensive, long and predictable. The root problem is the assumption that specifications can be validated for correctness, like a blueprint for a bridge can. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a persistent myth in software development.
- OOP is just a mental model. Deep down everything is made of bits. The temple of OOP has failed but if something looks like a duck, walks like a duck and talks like a duck it probably is useful to make a duck class. We're now down to fighting for nuances. You can do most things with OOP or without OOP but each path has some upsides and downsides and most of the time it's good to use some things it provides where it makes sense and not get too religious about it. The great architect has the foresight on how the code will be used in five years and design it accordingly.
- Studying logic taught me one of the more important distinctions in life is identifying when things are always true vs sometimes true. We are taught to often group things that are mostly true into the always true category. This is effectively lossy compression that can introduce serious error into your line of reasoning.
- But what Moore's law giveth, web developers taketh away. If you want to use a computer to participate in the modern society, you need much more than a Raspberry Pi, due to web bloat.

- Managing Partner or General Partners have the mojo inside venture capital firms. If you have anyone else prospecting you or working on the deal with you (associate, senior associate, principal, venture partner or EIR), treat them with an enormous amount of respect, but insist on developing a direct relationship with an MD or a GP as well. Anyone other than an MD or a GP is unlikely to be at the firm for the long haul. The MDs and GPs are the ones who matter and who will make decisions about your company.

- "Imagine that it's 2006, and you see an iPhone sitting on the table. Is your first instinct to turn it over to see who makes it, and to try to figure out what it might cost, and how is it distributed, and how many people might want it? Or is your first instinct to ask, why doesn't it have a keyboard? And why did they sell it through their own store? Why didn't they sell it through other stores?” If you're the first person, you're an investor. If you're the second person, you're an operator. — Andy Rachleff (Founder, WealthFront)
- Human nature leads us to want to be right every time. That's how we're evaluated in most everything in our lives. But without risk, you don't get reward. If you don't take risks, you don't get big returns. I apply the same pattern to my life —  try lots of different thing, not all of which are going to work, and I don't care. I just care about the magnitude of the ones that do. That's really, really hard for inexperienced people or regular employees to understand.
- The workplace is currently the worst place to actually do work!

- "In today's materialistic world, there is a risk of people becoming slaves to money. As though they were simply cogs in a huge money-making machine. This does nothing for human dialogue, dignity, freedom, and genuine well-being. Wealth should serve humanity, and not the other way around." — Dalai Lamad
- "I’ve noticed that many people compete in games they don’t understand because they are modeling the behavior of people around them. Most common is the competition for wealth as a proxy for happiness." — Michael Seibel

- Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.
- Someone told me not long ago that in order to succeed, you have to understand which rules you’re supposed to break. If you break the wrong rules, you’re finished. And so the easiest thing to do is follow all the rules. But then you consign yourself to a lower status. The real trick is understanding what rules are not meant for you.
- Put the concerns of the customer first before yours. We see the opposite happen all the time in software development. You have two systems that somehow don't talk to each other. Instead of implementing some kind of connector between them, you make the customer log in twice and transfer information between the two systems. In this case, the maker has prioritized their convenience over that of the user. This is the wrong approach.
- A junior will create the thing or carry out the task that's asked of them with but are often tone deaf to the context that surrounds the request and outcomes desired. A senior will implicitly addresses the wider context, asking probing questions to that end, without prompt.
- “We are not interested in creating markets. It is too expensive. We are interested in exploiting markets early.” — Don Velentine, Founder of Sequoia (Godfather of start-up community)
- People who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it.
- Leadership is a choice you make rather than a place you sit. In other words, leadership comes from influence and not from your position. For this reason, even when you’re not in front, you’re still leading those around you.
- Leadership is about influence, not control. I am not the first person to make this observation, but it is worth repeating… Aspiring leaders would do well to stop focusing on control and figure out how to expand their influence.
- It’s lonely at the top. 99% of people are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for ‘realistic’ goals, paradoxically making them the most competitive. -- Tim Ferris
-  “The moment you accept total responsibility for EVERYTHING in your life is the day you claim the power the change ANYTHING in your life.” -Hal Elrod
-  "Unnecessary meetings (and most are) are a mutually-assured-destruction of time. Learning how to avoid them is a prerequisite of doing anything great." - Naval

-  Imagine you have to pick a bike to go on a trip. You're travelling on a well paved road through the woods. If you take a light & narrow wheeled racing bike, you'll travel much much faster than if you ride a knobbly wheeled mountain bike with suspension, as long as you stay on the road. As soon as you need to go off the road and cut a new path, you are going to wish you had that mountain bike, and the road bike is actually going to make you go much slower or just stop altogether. This is why, for a complex applications (most commercial software), I prefer the mountain bike. Yes, it's slower on certain paths, but when we need to "go off-road" I don't slow to a stop.
-  “The road must be trod, but it will be very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.” -- Elrond
-  It's good to see UX design problems analyzed from a technical perspective. Designers working on the web should be proficient at understanding the medium on which they work, and look beyond generating static images to toss over the wall for implementation.
- Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you spot the heat coming around the corner.
- If you think your idea is too big to start without funding or a full-time commitment, you're thinking too far ahead of yourself. Scale the idea back to its core and start immediately.
- “Comparison is the thief of joy.” — Theodore Roosevelt
- “Don’t compare yourself with anyone in this world. If you do so, you are insulting yourself.” — Bill Gates
- I think treating conpiracy theories, such as flat earth theory and others, as a rational argument to debunk is appealing, but ultimately unproductive. Here is an interesting article, https://jameshfisher.com/2019/01/20/my-parents-are-flat-earthers/, which casted the human perspective on the problem: at the root, believing a conspiracy theory gives self-importance to the believer, and it's, in a way, "fun". Considering this perspective, this phenomenon belongs to the class of problems whose easy angle of attack is the technical (rational, in this case), and the difficult one is the human. I'd argue that if one thinks that a flat earther is metaphorically a brick wall, and consequently a fool, opposing technical arguments against it is equally as foolish. It's actually the other side of the coin: yelling arguments to a wall is the mirrored human problem. It would be more productive to think more about why this belief is appealing to people (and why it's spreading), rather than proving it's false.

- Spend half your time learning many things shallowly and half your time learning a few things deeply -- your resourcefulness will know no bound.
- The point of open source is not to ritualistically compile our stuff from source. It’s the awareness that technology is not magic: that there is a trail of breadcrumbs any of us could follow to liberate our digital lives in case of a potential hostage situation. Should we so desire, open source empowers us to create and run our own essential tools and services.
- The problem is not people being uneducated. The problem is that people are educated just enough to believe what they have been taught, and not educated enough to question anything from what they have been taught.
