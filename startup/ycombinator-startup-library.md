# Y Combinator’s Startup Library

I have been part of Y Combinator's [Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/), and so far had graduated two ideas out of it. It is a really useful and informative, and keeps you on your toes if you are starting up.

> "Over the past 15 years, we’ve created many videos, podcasts and essays as resources for startup founders. We’ve now consolidated them here in the YC Startup Library."
