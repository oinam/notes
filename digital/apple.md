# Apple

[Apple](https://www.apple.com) has a closely knit computing ecosystem. We leverage the ecosystem to get things done easier, and seamlessly.

We try to stay with the default native apps and programs that comes with the OSes as much as possible. However, you still need few must-have tools, utilities, and programs that you need to get things done.

We also try to backups of our content in either open or universal formats to be able to move and decouple from Apple smoothly, if needed.

Here are some of the key non-apple applications that we use regularly;

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com), with its PowerPack, is the primary utility that drives the regular task that happens on the MacOS. If you do have PowerPack, look into its [WorkFlows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/).
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com) (free Alternatives: [Hidden Bar](https://superbits.co/hidden/)) for Better Menubar management, hide infrequently used apps.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) for windows management and positioning. This is a simple but fantastic tool. If you are looking for a few more features and customization will also like the paid [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/pro) version.
