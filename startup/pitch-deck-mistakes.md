## The Mistakes

1. Itâ€™s too long
2. Problem Slide. Even if you've developed the most innovative, cutting-edge technology the world has ever seen, people won't buy it if it's not solving a problem.
3. Solution. Learn to Different, Frame your story and know your go-to-market strategy.
4. Scalable. Unit Economics, Customer Acquisition, Exponential Growth.
5. Focus. Your pitch deck should demonstrate focus.
