# Your Product Demo Sucks Because it’s Focused on Your Product

“It occurred to me that I was an absolute expert at the product I was pitching — I was presenting [Monetate](https://monetate.com)'s products day in and day out to some of the biggest brands in the country — but people still didn't seem to really get it,” says Falcone. “It became abundantly clear that knowing your product doesn't make a demo successful.”

This is from an awesome article discussiing the gotchas of Robert Falcone, Director of Solutions Engineering, Monetate.

> “There will be haters. There will be doubters. And then there will be you proving them wrong.”

Here is a summarized, shortened, key highlights of the article. Read, and re-read the original article -- [Your Product Demo Sucks Because it’s Focused on Your Product](https://firstround.com/review/Your-Product-Demos-Suck-Because-Theyre-Focused-on-Your-Product/).

- “It became abundantly clear that knowing your product doesn't make a demo successful.”
- One of the easiest and biggest mistakes he sees is that companies don’t effectively craft their demo to fit their specific audience — i.e. they don’t distill their dozens of features and selling points into the few that will really resonate with this particular investor, prospect, or even prospective employee.
- Good demos don't have to be perfect for the product. They have to be perfect for the audience.
- “If you know what their (customers/audiance) primary concerns are, you can show them just enough of your product that aligns with their immediate problems and get a better result.”
- “When you're an expert on a product, you're actually in real danger, because you're much more likely to put your customer to sleep showing them every little thing — or they ask you a question you didn't predict and it totally throws off your momentum.”
- Instead of memorizing every nuance of your product, prep time is much better spent thinking up all the questions you want to ask your customers, and the questions you believe you'll get from them. If you can come up with answers to all of these questions, you'll go into your demo meeting with holistic, agile knowledge. You'll be able to hop from one part of the product to another with ease, and adapt to the unexpected. Note that these questions need to be for your audience too — you want to build a list that will help you gather as much information about them upfront as possible.
- You don't want a rock solid, set-in-stone plan. **You want a playbook.** You want to know all the plays but only run the ones you need in the moment.
- “Be upfront with the people you're talking to. Say outright, 'I'm going to start off today's conversation by taking just five minutes to ask you a few questions so that I can understand which features will be most important for you.' That way, you're all on the same page. You've framed things in a strong, clear, logical way, and you already have them participating in a dialogue.”
- “We really got to understand the challenges they were facing. The big one was that they had a hard time differentiating their customers, so they'd end up discounting their products for everyone at the end of every month to drive their numbers.”
- Unless you make yourself clear and relevant, customers will go with whatever company or competitor shows off the shiniest new object.
- It's very effective to use this same structure for a product demo. You want your audience to envision, and if possible, experience what life with your service or product will be like.
- As quickly as possible, get to 'here's what you told me your goal is, here's the challenge you told me is in the way, here's what it will look like when our product takes down that challenge.
- Mirror the energy in the room, the words they use, how they talk about their product and your product. You'll understand each other that much faster.
- Start macro so that you don't go over anyone's head and you frame your argument as simply as possible. Then go micro into the areas that align with your audience's specific interests.
- “What you want is for your audience to say, 'Okay, I buy into this first piece I'm hearing — it definitely aligns with the overall simplicity that we're looking for, and now I want to understand how to customize it for our specific needs.”
- Don't dodge silences. Use them to gather more information, carefully think through what you want to say next, and ensure you're not cutting anyone off.
- Control questions and answers throughout the demo so that you're keeping people engaged, constantly reinforcing your selling points, and fully understanding what they want from your product.
- Anticipate, prepare and rehearse until you can shuffle around your entire presentation and remain informative, unflustered and articulate.
- Kick off your demo with the outcome that everyone in the room wants. Make it clear how much better their lives and jobs could be if they used your product. Then pull back and explain why.
