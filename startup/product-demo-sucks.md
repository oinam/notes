# Your Product Demo Sucks Because it’s Focused on Your Product

“It occurred to me that I was an absolute expert at the product I was pitching — I was presenting [Monetate](https://monetate.com)'s products day in and day out to some of the biggest brands in the country — but people still didn't seem to really get it,” says Falcone. “It became abundantly clear that knowing your product doesn't make a demo successful.”

This is from an awesome article discussiing the gotchas of Robert Falcone, Director of Solutions Engineering, Monetate.

> “There will be haters. There will be doubters. And then there will be you proving them wrong.”

Here is a summarized, shortened, key highlights of the article. Read, and re-read the original article -- [Your Product Demo Sucks Because it’s Focused on Your Product](https://firstround.com/review/Your-Product-Demos-Suck-Because-Theyre-Focused-on-Your-Product/).

- “It became abundantly clear that knowing your product doesn't make a demo successful.”
- One of the easiest and biggest mistakes he sees is that companies don’t effectively craft their demo to fit their specific audience — i.e. they don’t distill their dozens of features and selling points into the few that will really resonate with this particular investor, prospect, or even prospective employee.
- Good demos don't have to be perfect for the product. They have to be perfect for the audience.
- “If you know what their (customers/audiance) primary concerns are, you can show them just enough of your product that aligns with their immediate problems and get a better result.”
- “When you're an expert on a product, you're actually in real danger, because you're much more likely to put your customer to sleep showing them every little thing — or they ask you a question you didn't predict and it totally throws off your momentum.”
- Instead of memorizing every nuance of your product, prep time is much better spent thinking up all the questions you want to ask your customers, and the questions you believe you'll get from them. If you can come up with answers to all of these questions, you'll go into your demo meeting with holistic, agile knowledge. You'll be able to hop from one part of the product to another with ease, and adapt to the unexpected. Note that these questions need to be for your audience too — you want to build a list that will help you gather as much information about them upfront as possible.
- You don't want a rock solid, set-in-stone plan. **You want a playbook.** You want to know all the plays but only run the ones you need in the moment.
