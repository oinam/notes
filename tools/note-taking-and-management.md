# Note Taking and Management

Methods, philosophies, and choices to manage notes, and to find a holistic method on how to deal with knowledge in your life.

## Tools

- [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron) is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note-taking application built on top of VSCode.
- [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by Roam Research, built on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and GitHub.
- [Logseq](https://logseq.com) is hugely inspired by Roam Research, Org Mode, Tiddlywiki and Workflowy.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of
a local folder of plain text Markdown files.
- [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.
