# Ganbaru

`Ganbaru` is the Japanese culture of doing the best in any job. It is an art of making boring tasks better. A job may be mundane, but find ways to bring meaning to it.

The idea of `Ganbaru` doesn’t necessarily mean putting in hours of work, going overboard with practice, or pushing yourself to a limit that can cause burnout. Exhaustion is not admirable and should not be sought after.

Even on the most adventurous of journeys, we will have to face dull tasks along the way. Instead of shuffling through the drudgery, try embodying the spirit of `Ganbaru`. Just because you don’t feel enthusiasm for a task at hand doesn’t mean you have no say in influencing the way you experience it.
