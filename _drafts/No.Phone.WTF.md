# No.Phone.WTF

A tool does its job, then gets out of the way.

Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of the internet age, but instead rejects the way so many people currently engage with these tools.
— Cal Newport

“The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life.”
— Marie Kondo

To KonMari your apps:
Unlock your phone.
Start going through your apps.
For each app, ask yourself: “Does this spark joy?”.
If it doesn’t, delete the app and sincerely thank it for serving its purpose.
For some apps, this will be easy. For others, it’ll be hard. If you’re in doubt, I recommend deleting the app — you can always download it again. You’ll at least be able to see what your life is like without it.

Take ownership of what apps are allowed to be on your phone.

My solution: choose what notifications you get for every single app on your phone. This might seem like a daunting task, but it’s very rewarding. Similar to deleting apps that you don’t need of your phone, choosing notifications helps you take charge of what’s allowed to take your attention.
