1. __Lecturing__ -- Be as direct as possible.
2. __Blackboard Technique__ -- Be clear and conscise.
3. __Publish the same result several times__ -- Most successful endeavors are iterations upon your previous work, keep iterating.

5. __Every mathematician has only a few tricks__ -- Everyone has specialized skills, there's fame in using them to their fullest potential to explore many areas.
6. __Do not worry about your mistakes__ -- There are two kinds of mistakes - (i) fatal mistakes that destroy a theory, (ii) but there are also contingent ones, which are useful in testing the stability of a theory.
7. __Use the Feynman method__ -- -- Keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps.
8. __Give lavish acknowledgments__ -- Be generous with Credit To Others no matter how small.
9. __Write informative introductions__ -- Summarize everything clearly and as long as is necessary: show your work second.
10. __Be prepared for old age__ -- Your position as an authority will change abruptly. Someonoe will come along that is faster, better, stronger than you. Do not try to compare, compete, and validate against others.
