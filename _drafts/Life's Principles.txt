## Essentialism

A better and more modern form of Minimalism. Buy/Use only the essential ones. Be less and be content with what is the basic requirements.

## Taoism

One of the core concepts of Taoism is the harmony of opposites. Basically Taoism acknowledges that the human mind loves binaries: white -vs- black, right -vs- left, soft -vs- hard, good -vs- evil. This is the way we are wired to think, but it’s also inaccurate. Nature does not honor such strict distinctions. To the point that their usefulness at all is debatable. They make complex thought easier by eliminating some aspects of variation, but they also make us vulnerable to big mistakes when the pattern doesn’t hold.

Taoists understand that we’re inclined to over-optimize based on these false dichotomies. If softness is a desirable feature in given context we try to eliminate all hardness. If white is preferable, we scrub away the black. These states of purity are not just unattainable, they are built on a dichotomy that is not real. This insight went on to influence Buddhism, particularly what would ultimately become Zen Buddhism.

Taoists believe that the path to the truth is in harmonizing the dichotomy. Recognizing that humans are unlikely to be able to abandon binaries altogether and simply putting a bit of black in the white, and a bit of white in the black. That’s why the symbol of Taoism is the yin-yang.
