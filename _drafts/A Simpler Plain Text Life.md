# A Simpler, perhaps Future-Proof, Plain Text Life

I’m always on the look-out to simplify my digital activities and usage. I’m on a Mac, so this article will reflect a macOS language but the philosophy and ideas should be applicable to other Operating Systems too.

Plain text is software and operating system agnostic. It's searchable, portable, lightweight, and easily manipulated. It's unstructured. It works when web servers are down, or when the Internet is not working. There's no exporting and importing, no databases or tags or flags or stars or prioritizing or any other proprietary induced rules on what you can and can't do with it.

I still use Plain Text, but don’t hesitate to write in [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). MarkDown is well established, open, and really easy to jump in. This makes it easy for any tool to read it, better yet if it can parse MarkDown.

## The Advantages of Text Files

Plain text works everywhere, all the time, and will likely do so well into the future. It will not require an upgrade, a subscription, an app, an account, a purchase.
Plain text files are the most flexible file format ever. They can be opened by any tool or program or app or the Command line.
Easily Portable. Works on all Operating Systems.
Text Files are Future-Proof.

## The Disadvantages of Text Files

The User Experience is not that good. It is entirely dependent on the tools that can support.
No Rules. Harder to be disciplined in maintenance.

## Tools

[The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/) - It has a generous 60 day trial, after which you can buy it for $19.99 and is worth it. It cannot parse sub-folders. I hope it is coming soon.
[LightPaper](https://getlightpaper.com) 14 day free trial, cost $17.69

## Todo.txt

Simplicity is [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org)'s core value.

You're not going to find many checkboxes, drop-downs, reminders, or date pickers here.

Todo.txt apps are minimal, todo.txt-focused editors which help you manage your tasks with as few keystrokes and taps possible.

Sync it up via iCloud, Dropbox, or any other file sharing software and you’re set to use todo.txt anywhere, be it on the Desktop, the web or a mobile device.

Learn the very few, [simple set of rules](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) and you’ll be all set to have a blissful todo.txt life.

A todo.txt can also be a default files in your project for groups/teams to share a common todo list. There are IDE plugins that parses the todo.txt for a better visual representation.

## Tools

- [Texts](http://www.texts.io/)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)
- [PDSite](http://pdsite.org)

My effort is to evolve to a much simpler life, either digital or otherwise, try to use the least number of tools, just stay with the essentials.
