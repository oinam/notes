# Farm Bot

> [FarmBot](https://farm.bot) is an open source precision agriculture CNC (Computer Numerical Control) farming project consisting of a Cartesian coordinate robot farming machine, software and documentation including a farming data repository. The project aims to “Create an open and accessible technology aiding everyone to grow food and to grow food for everyone.”

The FarmBot Genesis is able to plant over 30 different crops including potatoes, peas, squash, artichokes and chard in an area of 2.9 meters × 1.4 meters with a maximum plant height of 0.5 meters. It can cultivate a variety of crops within same area at the same time and is able to operate indoors, outdoors and covered areas.

The Farmbot Genesis can perform almost all processes prior to harvesting including sowing, mechanical weed control and watering. It requires electricity, an internet connection and water supply which can be provided using off grid solutions including a water barrel to collect rain and a solar panel and battery to provide electricity. The FarmBot Genesis is able to gather data to take into account factors such as age of the plant and local weather conditions from both local sensors and external data from the internet.
