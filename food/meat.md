# Meat

The safest way to thaw frozen meat is in the refrigerator. Generally, an average size cut of meat takes a day to fully defrost in a fridge.

It is not recommended that you defrost meat by leaving it out at room temperature on the kitchen counter, because you shouldn’t leave meat out at room temperature for more than 2 hours.

When frozen, most meat, can be kept for 6-8 months! Bacon can be frozen for about 6 months.
