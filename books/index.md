## How to read books the right way

1. Pick up multiple books (physical, digital, or audio) from the same topic or category to go deeper.
2. It is OK not to finish a book you don’t like.
3. Some books are more flexible and might not be read linearly. It does depend on the topic of book you’re reading. It’s okay to pick up chapters if the book is meant to be a collection of answers to unrelated topics.
4. Write notes, highlight them, or stick tiny stickies on pages (for physical books).
5. You can [speed-read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading) parts and sections that might not be useful to remember.
6. While reading you might come across topics you don’t know much about. While you’re still finishing the book, read a brief summary to get through the current content. Write them down separately to research more later.
7. Try to write a summary after you’ve read the whole book.
8. Find your format/style or mix them up - digital, physical, audio.
