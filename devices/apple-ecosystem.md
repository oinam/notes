# Apple Ecosystem

[Apple](https://www.apple.com) has closely knit computing ecosystem. We leverage the ecosystem to get things done easier, smarter, and seamlessly.

We try to stay with the defaults that comes with the OSes as much as possible. However, you still need few must-have tools, utilities, and programs that you need to get things done.

Here are some of the interesting and useful applications that we use regularly.

- [1Password](https://1password.com). At the start of the 21st century, we started with [Keepass](https://keepass.info) as the entry into the world of Password Management but moved to 1Password (2006) since its beta and haven't looked back.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) with its PowerPack is the primary utility that drives the regular task that happens on the MacOS. If you do have PowerPack, look into its [WorkFlows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/).
- [Apple One](https://one.apple.com)
- [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com)
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
