There are a huge variety of intra-organizational communication systems, to the point where pretty much every large enterprise provider seems to have one (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, etc etc). These work fine inside an organization or a closed group of people, and they can be better than email in various ways (hence their popularity). But all of them are at best cumbersome when you want to reach out for inter-organizational communication, to work with an outsider, and they always will be because they aren't federated (especially across service boundaries).</p> <p>There are some services that aspire to being universal in this way, such as Facebook with WhatsApp (which is used for for customer communication by businesses in some areas of the world). But since they're all central and non-federated, they all suffer from having to trust the central service provider or, to put it another way, they suffer from people not wanting to give any single party that much power. A world where everyone communicates between organizations over WhatsApp is a world where Facebook holds a huge amount of power (and probably gets paid actual money by someone), and plenty of organizations don't want that.</p> <p>The prospect for another federated, Internet wide communication system seem very remote at this point in time, so email is it. The practical alternative is probably some dystopian version of the Internet where one of the centralized systems wins out so everyone has to be on it.</p> <p>(SMS is a federated system for some portion of the people on the Internet, but it has various disadvantages. Some of them come about due to history, but others come about because SMS was monetized from the start. And like email, SMS messaging has its own spam problems, which doesn't encourage people to open it up more.)</p> <p>I think a corollary of this is that it's to the advantage of all of the big centralized systems to keep email alive. If they kill email, on the one hand it could drive people to their central system, but on the other hand it might force people to someone else's central system, because people will be forced to do something and they probably won't join everyone's system (especially if there's a cost associated). As long as there's no obvious winning central communication system, all of them have a lot to potentially lose if email dies.</p>"},{"location":"digital/email/#tools-setup-and-maintenance","title":"Tools, Setup, and Maintenance","text":"<p><code>DMARC, SPF, DKIM</code></p> <ul> <li>An interactive tutorial on how email's DMARC, SPF, and DKIM work.</li> <li>https://dmarcian.com</li> <li>https://easydmarc.com</li> <li>Use plaintext email</li> </ul>"},{"location":"digital/linux/","title":"Linux","text":"<p>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.</p>"},{"location":"digital/linux/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>A thorough, inspiring, simple, and clean Linux Desktop Setup</li> <li>5 Best Practices for Securing SSH</li> <li>Bash One-Liners and terminal tricks</li> </ul>"},{"location":"digital/macos/","title":"macOS","text":""},{"location":"digital/macos/#user-interface","title":"User Interface","text":"<p>Dark Theme for Menubar and Dock but overall Light Theme.</p> <ol> <li>System Preferences, then set the theme to LIGHT, then run</li> <li><code>defaults write -g NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool Yes</code></li> <li>Logout, then System Preferences, then set the theme to DARK.</li> </ol> <p>Reset back to the default theme.\\ <code>defaults write -g NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool No</code></p> <p>Expand Print Panel by Default</p> <pre><code>defaults write -g PMPrintingExpandedStateForPrint -bool true &amp;&amp; \\\ndefaults write -g PMPrintingExpandedStateForPrint2 -bool true\n</code></pre> <p>Screenshots Location\\ <code>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location &lt;custom-folder-location&gt;</code></p> <p>Quit Printer App After Print Jobs Complete\\ <code>defaults write com.apple.print.PrintingPrefs \"Quit When Finished\" -bool true</code></p>"},{"location":"digital/macos/#finder","title":"Finder","text":"<p>Stop ds_store creation on shared network drives\\ <code>defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true</code></p> <p>Revert back to default\\ <code>defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores false</code></p>"},{"location":"digital/macos/#dock","title":"Dock","text":"<p>Disable Dock Auto Hide Animation\\ <code>defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -int 0;killall Dock</code></p> <p>Reset Back to Default\\ <code>defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier;killall Dock</code></p>"},{"location":"digital/macos/#menu","title":"Menu","text":"<p>Clean up the \"Open With\" Menu</p> <pre><code>/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"digital/macos/#misc","title":"Misc","text":"<p>Flush DNS Cache</p> <pre><code>sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder; sudo killall mDNSResponderHelper; sudo dscacheutil -flushcache\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"digital/macos/#turn-off-microsoft-autoupdate","title":"Turn off \u2018Microsoft AutoUpdate\u2019","text":"<p>check status\\ <code>launchctl print-disabled gui/$(id -u) | grep microsoft</code></p> <p>disable the service\\ <code>launchctl disable gui/$(id -u)/com.microsoft.update.agent</code></p>"},{"location":"digital/macos/#block-websites","title":"Block Websites","text":"<ol> <li><code>sudo nano /etc/hosts</code></li> <li>Add <code>0.0.0.0 siteToBlock.com</code></li> <li>Save &gt; Exit (CTRL + x &gt; y)</li> </ol>"},{"location":"digital/macos/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>Mac keyboard shortcuts</li> <li>Awesome macOS Command Line (archive)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"digital/para/","title":"PARA","text":"<p>While there are a lot of organizational patterns and processes, PARA is a simple, easy to get started, and extends when needed.</p> <ul> <li>Projects<ul> <li>For each folder in the <code>PROJECTS</code> folder, there is a clear definition of \u201cdone.\u201d To keep a chronological overview, you label each folder with start and end dates.</li> <li>Folder: \u201cProject Name (YYYY-MM)\u201d</li> <li>Folder for Completed: \u201cProject Name (YYYY-MM - YYYY-MM)\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li>Areas<ul> <li>Folders in the <code>AREAS</code> are kind of the opposite of projects.

According to this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness. The hedonic treadmill viewpoint suggests that wealth does not increase the level of happiness.</p> <p>As a species, we are extraordinary good at getting used to things, such that very few events in life have a long-term impact on our happiness: births, marriages, deaths, promotions, demotions, etc can all occur to us or around us and typically, after 6 months, our self-reported happiness levels will be back where there were before. If you don\u2019t believe me, think how annoyed you get when the WiFi doesn\u2019t work, then consider that humanity existed quite happily without it for hundreds of thousands of years.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important case of adaptation comes from the Easterlin Paradox, named after the economist who found it, which is that self-reported life satisfaction scores in the developed world have barely improved over the last 60 years (since we started asking these questions) despite massive increases in GDP. It\u2019s not just that we\u2019re collectively richer, we\u2019re also healthier, living longer in safer societies with better technology than ever before. Even though we\u2019re doing better on nearly every measure of progress, we don\u2019t seem to be getting happier. We adapt just as readily to negative life events too, and studies find those who become disabled report partial to near total adaptation to their conditions. </p> <p>There are a number of reasons we get these wrong but here are the main three.</p> <ol> <li>when we think about the future, we tend to focus only on one aspect of the event and ignore the others. This is called \u2018focalism\u2019 or the \u2018focusing illusion\u2019. So if you ask people if they\u2019d be happier living in California or the Midwest, most people say California. Actually the regions have comparable life satisfaction, but people say California because they think of the weather and fail to take account of other things, such as the fact that California is full of tedious hippies.</li> <li>\u2018immune neglect\u2019, is that we are often unaware that we\u2019ll adapt to the good or bad things that happen. For instance, studies show people expect their break-ups to be longer and more painful than they are, in part because we forget that our psychological immune system will kick in and we\u2019ll decide we never liked the person anyway.</li> <li>we rely on our memories to make future judgements, but our memories are pretty faulty. For instance, we tend not to remember the whole of an experience (\u2018duration neglect\u2019) but instead remember the peaks and ends of our experiences (the \u2018peak-end effect\u2019). Daniel Kahneman famously showed people preferred longer, more painful surgeries with a less painful end to shorter, less painful surgeries because they couldn\u2019t remember how they felt at the time. In other words, last night\u2019s party was never as good as you think it was.</li> </ol> <p>Change how you think and spend your time. In terms of changing how you think, I\u2019d suggest Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and positive psychology. For those unfamiliar with them, the basic ideas are that CBT teaches people to understand their thoughts and stop negative thinking patterns, MBSR helps people accept, rather than fight, negative emotions and so reduce the suffering they cause, and positive psychology trains people to find more positive emotions, such as by encouraging people to be grateful. </p> <p>Mindfulness is starting to become popular, but the other two are basically unknown. I really hope this changes: given how good we are at adapting these look like the best options for becoming happier over the long term. In just a few minutes a day, you can rewire the way your brain works.</p> <p>We seem happiest when we\u2019re socialising with other people, outside or doing something that seems meaningful to us (on paper, the Army was a great idea). Will MacAskill has talked about finding purpose in your life through effective altruism, so he\u2019s probably better placed than me to talk about that.</p> <p>Happy people are more likely to get married, get promoted, earn more, have more friends, be healthier, live longer, etc. The basic explanation is that we like being around happy people, and this small difference has a long-term advantage. So, if you want to become richer, become happier. I stress being richer won\u2019t do much for your happiness but it does mean, if you\u2019re a high-flying executive and you think your colleagues will make fun of you for practising mindfulness and writing down three things each day you\u2019re grateful, you could always tell them you\u2019re just doing it to make more money. </p>"},{"location":"life/happy-life/#there-kinds-of-happiness","title":"There kinds of happiness","text":"<p>There are two main senses of happiness: we use the word as an evaluative term to describe what makes someone\u2019s life go well for them, or as a descriptive term to refer to a set of psychological states. For the first sense, philosophers tend to use the word \u2018wellbeing\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s equivalent to flourishing or \u2018eudaimonia\u2019, sometimes called prudential value. The second sense describes things that are more like enjoyment or contentment \u2013 and the opposite of suffering and pain.

Following philosophical convention, when I talk about \u2018happiness\u2019 I\u2019m only referring to psychological states, not wellbeing. </p> <p>I think it\u2019s helpful to break up experiences of happiness into a \u2018pleasure\u2019 and a \u2018meaning\u2019 dimension.

Part of the wisdom of meditation lies in the following: There is baggage we all carry, the self, this belief we're the center of it all. How do I stop doing what makes me unhappy, if that's \"who I am\"? But, in reality, I can abandon \"who I am\" and find new processes of living and new ways of thinking about the world.</p> <p>In practice, this resetting of your mind is achieved without training by various psychdelic drugs, which peel back the layers of the onion in an effortless fashion. In meditation, you train your mind to actually pay close attention, eventually achieving an effortless open-ness that drugs achieve very simply. Once you're good at following your breath, you can turn to thoughts and feelings, recognizing them as mere arisings in consciousness.</p> <p>Mere arisings in the mind do not require response: there's no need to act upon our desires, urges, distraction, and regular patterns, they are just heuristics or mental shortcuts the brain uses over and over to save time/effort of decision making. Do we have to respond to all our noticing sounds, light, smells? If not, why do we have to respond to negative thoughts?</p> <p>Negative thoughts may become crystallized into negative actions. However, if you know what behaviors of your own contribute to unhappiness, you can always pause for 10-15 seconds, meditate briefly, drawing upon your training of the brain's meditative ability, and you will notice the actual feeling of the urge to behave, and not act upon it. It will disappear like very other appearance in consciousness.</p> <p>Some overlap with Stoicism here. From the Enchiridion of Epictetus:</p> <p>Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.</p> <p>The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.</p>"},{"location":"life/have-a-life-mission-and-persevere/","title":"Have a life's Mission, and Persevere","text":"<p>I chuckled at a very truthful comment by Ericson Smith --</p> <p>It's rarely said that marriage, kids, job, degree, a house, car, and most physical things are not missions.

The process is often conceptualized as a treadmill, since no matter how hard one tries to gain an increase in happiness, one will remain in the same place.</p> <p>Hedonic adaptation can occur in a variety of ways. Generally, the process involves cognitive changes, such as shifting values, goals, attention and interpretation of a situation. The process of adaptation can also occur through the tendency of humans to construct elaborate rationales for considering themselves deprived through a process called -- abundance denial.</p> <p>For example, a person moving into a 400-square-foot apartment may not initially observe much of a difference between her apartment and the 450-square-foot apartment next door. However, after she adapts to her current apartment, the apartment next door begins to appear much larger and more favorable in comparison. She may even become motivated to try to switch apartments.</p> <p>It is different from <code>desensitization</code>. Desensitization is characterized by reduced sensitivity toward differences in a stimulus. People who are desensitized would not notice the difference between their current 400-square-foot apartment and the 450-square-foot apartment next door, nor would they be motivated to attempt to substitute their apartment for the larger one. Thus, although desensitization and hedonic adaptation share certain characteristics, hedonic adaptation cannot be explained as merely desensitization to a stimulus.</p> <p>Hedonic adaptation may be a more common phenomenon when dealing with positive events as opposed to negative ones. Negativity bias, where people tend to focus more on negative emotions than positive emotions, can be an obstacle in raising one's happiness set point. Negative emotions often require more attention and are generally remembered better, overshadowing any positive experiences that may even outnumber negative experiences. Given that negative events hold more psychological power than positive ones, it may be difficult to create lasting positive change.</p> <p>Source: The Effects of Variety and Novelty on Physical Activity and Healthy Nutritional Behaviors</p>"},{"location":"life/how-to-assess-someones-character/","title":"How to assess someone's character","text":"<ol> <li>Listen to what they don't talk about.</li> <li>Pay attention to the questions they ask.</li> <li>Look at how they treat those who can do nothing for them.</li> <li>Listen to how they talk about their parents.</li> <li>Look at how they actually spend their days.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"life/laws/","title":"Laws","text":"<p>A few interesting universal Laws.</p> <ul> <li>Amara: \u201cWe tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.\u201d</li> <li>Murphy: \u201cThe more you fear something happening, the more likely it is to occur.\u201d</li> <li>Kidlin: \u201cIf you write a problem down clearly and specifically, you have solved half of it.\u201d</li> <li>Gilbert: \u201cWhen you take on a task, finding the best ways to achieve the desired result is always your responsibility.\u201d</li> <li>Wilson: \u201cIf you prioritize knowledge and intelligence, money will continue to come.\u201d</li> <li>Falkland: \u201cIf you don't have to make a decision about something, then don't decide.\u201d</li> <li>Moore: \u201cThe number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years.\u201d</li> </ul>"},{"location":"life/leadership/","title":"Leadership","text":"<p>Leaders focus on doing the right thing, managers focus on doing things right.</p>"},{"location":"life/leadership/#12-quick-and-simple-ways-to-become-a-great-leader-in-2016","title":"12 Quick and Simple Ways to Become a Great Leader in 2016","text":"<p>http://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/12-quick-and-simple-ways-to-become-a-great-leader-in-2016.html</p> <ol> <li>Think big</li> <li>Think Strategically</li> <li>Get forgiveness, not permission</li> <li>Forget about titles and pedigrees</li> <li>Make more leaders</li> <li>Be open and transparent</li> <li>Take responsibility;

Get a business grade router and get your wifi via access points.</p> <p>Wi-Fi makes you feel like living in the future, where Internet just works in the air. But if you happen to peel and look just underneath, it is one of the worst offender for your bad Internet.

If multiple wireless networks are operating on the same \u201cchannel\u201d (radio frequency band), their transmissions can interfere with each other. When that happens your device needs to re-send the same information, which makes your wifi slow.</p> <p>That means in dense areas, such as apartment buildings, routers will often pick a bad channel and end up interfering with each other. There\u2019s no way for your router or device to notify you if it\u2019s experiencing interference, so you\u2019ll only learn about it if you know how fast your router \u201cshould\u201d be and notice that it\u2019s slower</p> <p>Dead zones.

Unless you know a lot about how radio waves interact with building materials, it\u2019s hard to predict where your dead zones are.</p> <p>Polling. Any program on your computer can ask your wireless card to enumerate the nearby networks. This causes it to go into \u201cpolling mode,\u201d where it spends less time transmitting data and more time listening for routers advertising their network info (it can\u2019t transmit and receive at the same time).

Since verbs are the \u201cengine\u201d of your writing, choose powerful and accurate ones instead of tacking \u201c-ly\u201d words on to dull verbs.</li> <li>Avoid the passive voice: While the passive voice adds words to sentences, it also distances readers from what\u2019s happening.

Instead of beginning with \u201cthere,\u201d try flipping the sentence around and starting with a noun.</li> <li>Swap nouns for verbs: Many times, writers unnecessarily water down sentences by using phrases that could be single words.
