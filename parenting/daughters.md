1. __The world will try to steal your joy.__\
The world doesn’t like when a person is walking around with joy and happiness. Be ready for trial, drama, and full attacks in your way of life. Meet them with grace and an attitude that you will persevere. You create your own joy.
2. __Kids learn a lot from parents, they should act accordingly.__\
Kids learn how to love from their parents and pick up the worst parts of the parents as well. Don’t be fake and try to act like a perfect person. Instead be real with your kids and show them what life is like when you laugh and love.
3. __People can change.__\
People will show you their best and worst sides as you grow up. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that the world is all good or all bad. Have the wisdom to know that no matter what people are going through there is always the power for them to change.
4. __Your parents loves you.__\
You will argue. You will laugh. You will cry. Remember that no matter how mad they makes you, they loves you. Your parents sees endless possibilities when looking at you and wants you to succeed. No matter what you do or where you go. No matter how you act or what you say.
5. __If it feels wrong, it is.__\
Nothing should be forced in this life. If you ever find yourself in a situation that feels off, remove yourself. Trust your gut always and stand up for what you believe in.
6. __Don’t worry about the future.__\
Worrying about tomorrow only steals joy from the day. All the deadlines, boys, and arguments will work themselves out. Focus on being in the moment and the future will take care of itself.
7. __Your last name matters.__\
Our last name is special because it comes with a lot of history. Not all of it is glamorous, but you are living proof that generational curses can be broken. Take pride in where you come from and keep working to make our last name grow in legacy.
8. __The world is bigger than your hometown.__\
You will think that your hometown is the entire world until the day you leave those city limits. Travel, experience, and learn about different cultures around the world. Open your eyes to all that life has to offer. It’s a big world.
9. __You don’t have to go to college.__\
Maybe you will, maybe you won’t. A college degree doesn’t promise you anything. The real way to win is by being a lifelong learner and pursuing your dreams with drive and determination. Never stop learning.
10. __Start investing early, at least by 18.__\
Unless you parents have started something for you already, start from scratch and you are early compared to your peers. Learn what compound interest is and put aside, say, 25% of your earnings into a fund (mutual funds or other relevant oes) monthly and never touch it. You can live off the other 75% despite what anyone else tells you. As you start to earn more keep the percentages the same.
11. __Sports can teach you a lifetime of values.__\
Sports teaches you what it feels like to give it out all and still lose. It teaches that everything great in life has an ending and be competitive in life but with grace. Play a sport.
12. __Grit is learned through experience.__\
Grit is defined as strength of character in moments of uncertainty. You can read books or watch as many movies as you want but you can’t learn grit until you go through tough times yourself. Don’t shy away from difficult, embrace it and you will grow.
13. __You aren’t defined by your losses.__\
I’ve seen so many people that have never overcome losses in their life. They are constantly defeated and eventually stop trying. Losses are learning opportunities that will develop true character. It’s okay to lose, but not to be a loser.
14. __Winning isn’t the goal, growing is.__\
Winning is amazing. There is no better feeling than winning after putting in the hard work it takes to win. Remember that if you become addicted to winning you will never be satisfied. Winning is part of growing not the only goal.
15. __If you feel like you aren’t enough, remember you are.__\
You don’t see it but sometimes parents don’t feel like they are being the best parents. Then we are reminded that everyday we get to love you and our family. Never think you are not enough. A day where you move an inch is still progress.
16. __Choose your husband/partner wisely.__\
This is the man that will be with you on your greatest and worst days. Choose a man that will see you for who you are, and love the family.
17. __Don’t tell everyone what you’re doing.__\
People will use information against you to push their own agenda. Working in silence is a superpower. Let them see what you have been doing when you are standing on the mountaintop.
18. __Take care of your body.__\
You will be unstoppable if you develop healthy habits early and keep them for the rest of your life. Do physical activities (walk, run, gym, active sports, etc.) and maintaining a body that is happy and healthy. You don’t have to be the fittest person in the world, but don’t ever stop.
