# How To Invest In Yourself

https://medium.com/life-learning/how-to-invest-in-yourself-417fab1bc665#.cuyx92s7e

Here’s What You’ll Need:

* A note taking app or notebook
* A spreadsheet app (Airtable is amazing)
* A browser for research
* A calendar or calendar app

4 Steps

1. Write A List Of 100 Things
Divide the list into these 3 categories:
* 		Things that I need skills for
* 		Things that I can do immediately
* 		Things that I need time for

2. Create a skill chart

All you need is 4 columns.
A column that lists the skills you have to learn
A column for Research
A column for Action
A column for Progress

3. Take immediate action
4. The things you need time for

Turn it all into your daily routine. Start every morning by reading through your master list. Reading your skills chart and working out whether or not you’ve progressed. Evaluating whether you’ve marked your immediate tasks from your calendar. Checking your time log.

When you want to accomplish anything, the best way to do it is to stop dreaming. To focus and treat it like a project you’re being paid to do. A project that your job depends on. A project for the biggest asshole you’ll ever work for — yourself.

Working backwards from there, we made this set of Anti-Goals:
* Never schedule an in-person meeting when it can otherwise be accomplished via email or phone (or not at all)
* No more than 2 hours of scheduled time per day
* No business or obligations with people we don’t like—even just a slight bad vibe and it’s a hard no
* Never give up voting control of our businesses, no favors from people who could need something from us (ensure the rule of reciprocity doesn’t kick in)
* Work from a cafe across from a beautiful park where we can come and go as we please with nobody to bother us
* Video conference or pay for people to come visit us
* Never schedule morning meetings, sleep in when needed
