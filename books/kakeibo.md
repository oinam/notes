# Kakeibo: The Japanese Art of Budgeting Saving Money by Fumiko Chiba

This is an introduction to the Japanese Kakeibo-method of budgeting money - a 100+ year old method. It was introduced to the public in 1904 by Hani Motoko for housewives to use, and backed by the goverment. Housewives in Japan have much power over household money.

There are just about ten pages of [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Kakeibo-Japanese-Art-Saving-Money/dp/0525538038/) on the methodology; the rest are pages for one year of doing this. But it's still worth buying. There's one for weekly, monthy, and yearly ways of budgeting, and it helps one to contemplate the result and what one wants to achieve with saving a little to some projects like traveling, buying bigger things, birthdays etc.
