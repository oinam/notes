# The Checklist Manifesto

[The Checklist Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/)by Atul Gawande is a must-read book for your daily and professional life. The book looks at the use of checklists in the business world and the medical profession, with Gawande examining how it could be used for greater efficiency, consistency and safety.

Atul walks readers through his experience of how the modern medical system fails. The 20th century saw vast increases in medical knowledge, both through a richer understanding of the body, and from swathes of new drugs, tests, and surgical procedures. And yet, mistakes are still made; diagnoses are missed, critical tests aren’t run, standard treatments aren’t given. Even when the right answer is known by someone – and often by everyone involved – patients slip through the cracks.

> The first is diligence, the necessity of giving sufficient attention to detail to avoid error and prevail against obstacles. Diligence seems an easy and minor virtue. Diligence is both central to performance and fiendishly hard.

Every professions face the same basic problem -- the knowledge base and the complexity of the work grows until no single expert can fit all the relevant pieces into their head.

A checklist does not need to be long to be useful. One of the first checklists introduced in hospitals, aimed at decreasing central line infections in ICU patients, was trialled at John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, in 2001. It had five steps. The doctor was supposed to: 

1. Wash their hands with soap.
2. Clean the patient’s skin with chlorhexidine antiseptic.
3. Put sterile drapes over the entire patient.
4. Wear a mask, hat, sterile gown, and gloves.
5. Place a sterile dressing over the insertion site once the line was in.

But even in the poorest hospitals, using it saves lives. And there’s a broader lesson to be learned, here. In any complex field – which encompasses quite a lot of the modern world – even very obvious, straightforward instructions to check off for routine tasks can cut down on the cognitive overhead and reduce “careless” human error, making perfect performance much more feasible.
