# What to Work On

I love the writings of [Julian Shapiro](https://www.julian.com/) and his article, [What to Work on](https://www.julian.com/blog/life-planning) is another masterpiece.

> I spent an hour listing out everything I cared about — from human connection, to self-education, to wealth. In the process, I surprised myself: There is a better way to achieve these goals than pursuing a startup.

## Here are the questions to ask yourself.

Knowledge — Do you become more knowledgeable and skilled when doing it?
Adventure — Do you accrue novel, memorable experiences?
‍Fame — Do you build an audience you can later leverage?
‍Power — Do you acquire resources and connections?
Money — Do you increase your financial wealth?
Exercising Talent — Do you leverage your skill and creativity?
Human Connection — Do you bond with others?

Go, read the article. It can be pretty eye-opening - [What to Work on](https://www.julian.com/blog/life-planning).
