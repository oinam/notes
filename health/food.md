# Food

To prevent getting sick from Staph and other bacteria, you need to prevent it from growing in the first place — which means storing it at a safe temperature — at or below 40°F / 4°C in the fridge and at or 0°F / -18°C in the freezer.

If your fridge or freezer isn't cold enough you could be risking food poisoning — if it's too cold you could be wasting electricity and creating defrosting work for yourself. Optimize the temperature.
