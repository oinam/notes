## Eliminate

How can we cut out the trivial many?

CLARIFY: One Decision That Makes a Thousand

## Execute
How can we make doing the vital few things almost effortless?

FLOW: The Genius of Routine
FOCUS: What’s Important Now?

Multitask but Focus on one thing at a time.

BE: The Essentialist Life

Get Used To Saying No, even to good opportunities, so you can say YES to the best of the opportunities.

Respect is better than being popular.

Less but Better.

We have heard the common term Less is More. However, we are still trying to prove that less is still "more". The right way, then is,  "Less but Better." Keeping things simple is difficult, and once you have too many choices, it is easy to make no choice. The discipline of consistently removing the non-essentials, to strip anything to its bare essentials, so that the precision of selecting what is truly important done over time will be rewarded exponentially. So, ask question -- What is the non-essential, and how I can take it out?

Focus on vital few and eliminate the trivial many. It is indeed the popular Pareto Principle[^pareto-principle] which states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few").

How would we know when we have succeeded?

If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will.


[^pareto-principle]: The [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few"). Other names for this principle are the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity.
