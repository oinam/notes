# 5 Whys

The [5 Whys Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys) was developed in the 1930s by [Sakichi Toyoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakichi_Toyoda), the founder of the automotive manufacturer Toyota Industries. The idea is simple: ask "why" 5 times, until you get to the root cause of your issue.

The first step is to defining the problem.

The next step is to keep asking "whys" until you get to the root of the problem.

Now, once the root cause of the problem is identified, it can then be addressed/resolved.

Finally, try to tackle secondary factors that are parts of the problem.
