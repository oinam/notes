# Atomic Habits

[Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits): An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones by James Clear is an extremely popular book.

> Atomic Habits is the most comprehensive and practical guide on how to create good habits, break bad ones, and get 1 percent better every day. I do not believe you will find a more actionable book on the subject of habits and improvement.

Chris Behan wrote an interesting summurization, aptly termed, [The Thinner Book: Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://www.chrisbehan.ca/posts/atomic-habits).

## The Three Layers of Behavior Change

1. Identity
2. Process
