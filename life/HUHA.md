Heads Up Hustle Anticipate.

The idea was that on family trips, especially with kids and at crowded places such as the airport or train-station, is to look around (Heads Up), talk and let your family know of things either interesting or out-of-place or strange (Hustle), and to Anticipate your next step, things to do, and what things might happen.
