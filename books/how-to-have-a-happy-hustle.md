# How to Have a Happy Hustle: The Complete Guide to Making Your Ideas Happen by Bec Evans

Stories about successful startups usually make it seem like their founders are geniuses who are struck by divine inspiration. But in fact, anyone can come up with a good idea if he’s prepared to put in some time and hone skills like creative thinking, empathy, and resilience in the face of failure.

Usually, problems are something from which we want to run away. Who wants to sit and dwell on everything that’s wrong with life and the world? No one. If you’re looking for the next brilliant startup idea, though, you’re going to have to come to terms with problems. Believe it or not, they’re actually the best place to find inspiration.

Well, choosing the perfect problem is both systematic and intuitive. It helps to take a step back and evaluate each problem against objective criteria, like whether you have the expertise necessary to tackle it, whether there’s a big market for the solution, and so on. But ultimately, you should trust your intuition. If the problem really excites you, go for it!

To identify your audience clearly, you have to go out and get to know them.

A persona, a model of your invention’s target user, is a great way to start – especially if your target market is significantly different from you. Evans once visited a team of software coders who were designing a game for middle-aged women with children. In order to make sure they were designing with the user in mind, the young male coders developed a persona called Barbara. They then tried to put themselves in Barbara’s shoes, constantly imagining what her life might be like and what her preferences might be. It worked. For example, instead of their original ideas to add gunfire and explosions to the game, they decided Barbara would prefer fireworks and popping champagne corks.

To find a solution to your problem, practice divergent thinking.

The Google investment fund Google Ventures uses an exercise called Crazy Eights to help entrepreneurs generate creative solutions. First, participants each fold a blank sheet of paper into eight panels. They’re then given five minutes to sketch eight different solutions to a given problem, one on each panel. This adds a helpful visual element, and the time constraints help circumvent any doubts participants might have about their drawing skills.

But one of the best ways to encourage divergent thinking is to work with diverse teams. Start by posing a problem to a group of people. Have them generate as many solutions as possible on Post-it notes, then discuss them, grouping common ideas together and using that to generate novel and wild ideas. This will lead to robust debate, which is the point of the exercise. Working together in a productive, generative way will allow a lot of high-quality, conflicting solutions to emerge; all you’ll have to do is pick the best of them!

Choose a solution, and get it into the world – fast.

Test your product on the right users.
Master the art of the pitch.

If you’ve got a great idea, it’s not uncommon to keep it to yourself out of concern that someone else might steal it. But keeping it to yourself can also be destructive, causing you to miss out on valuable feedback that could help improve your idea.

Cultivate a growth mindset and be prepared to fail.

Failure is so important, in fact, that in their very first week at the prestigious Singularity University, located on the NASA campus, students are given an assignment requiring them to go out into the world and fail as often as possible.

Grow your target market by understanding your community.

Gather emotional and financial resources to support your hustling.

In order to create your own happy hustle, you need to be pragmatic about what it takes to turn ideas into successful startups. You shouldn’t wait for creativity to strike, but instead, spot opportunities in the problems you encounter every day, and think of innovative ways to solve them. Then you need to get your ideas into the world as quickly as possible and get real feedback from your target market. Along the way you should be prepared to fail repeatedly, and have the resilience to see every part of the process as an opportunity to learn and grow your ideas.
