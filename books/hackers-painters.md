# Hackers & Painters

> "The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West, in which you can shoot anyone you wish with your ideas, if you’re willing to risk the consequences." — Paul Graham

A short-read, in less than 300 pages, of a good book by the [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com) founder, [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com).

Paul Graham explains the world we live in and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In a clear and thoughtful writing, drawing on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes us on an unflinching exploration into what he calls “an intellectual Wild West.”
