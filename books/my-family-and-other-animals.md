# My Family and Other Animals

When the unconventional Durrell family can no longer endure the damp, gray English climate, they do what any sensible family would do: sell their house and relocate to the sunny Greek isle of Corfu. [My Family and Other Animals](https://www.amazon.com/Family-Other-Animals-Corfu-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B06ZZMLMKT/) was intended to embrace the natural history of the island but ended up as a delightful account of Durrell’s family’s experiences, from the many eccentric hangers-on to the ceaseless procession of puppies, toads, scorpions, geckoes, ladybugs, glowworms, octopuses, bats, and butterflies into their home.

A book that will entertain everyone from a young reader to matured adults.
