# iPad as the Default

I had thought a lot about moving to an iPad Workflow and totally move away from the Laptop. The final decision was made the day I read Paul Stamatiouâ€™s article [Made on an iPad Pro](https://paulstamatiou.com/made-on-an-ipad-pro/).

Started by early August, 2018.
iPad Pro 12.9-inch 256GB Wi-Fi + Cellular.

The demand in India seems to be low, they had to order it for me and took more than 2 weeks. I settled for the 256GB instead of the much desired 512GB version.
Apple Smart Keyboard.
Apple Pencil.
