# Reboot: Leadership and the Art of Growing Up

To become a better leader, you need to learn to Reboot yourself, over and over again.

As a leader, one of the nagging questions you will ask yourself is, “Am I doing this right?”

Practice Radical Self-Inquiry.

Leaders need to go right back to the roots of who they are. So, rather than digging desperately through management books, articles, one needs to pause, then peer beneath the surface into who we really are.

The way we deal with a crisis defines us as leaders and as human beings.

A crisis is the best test of leadership. If once can come out of it with grace and steadfastness, then no matter the severity of the crisis, one will become a better leader, and a better person.

It is under extreme pressure that we learn that we can face the worst with courage, humility, and inspiration. We come out on the other side with new confidence. It’s always best to face the crisis head-on.

Sometimes, it is better to stand still than just keep pushing to the next thing. we, more often than not, rush from one thing to the next, to escape something.

As a leader, truth is always your friend and the best policy ever.

Our life is not a linear progression. "Life is more like Tetris. And Work more like Chess."

The best of leaders try to create space for others to become truly themselves.

Above all else, it pays to become more humane, courageous people, because that is the path to less-toxic workplaces and companies that act responsibly regarding their employees, communities, and everyone else.
