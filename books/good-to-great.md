# Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't

Good-to-great companies all found their own simple Hedgehog concept by asking themselves three key questions:

1. What can we be the best in the world at?
2. What can we be passionate about?
3. What is the key economic indicator we should concentrate on?

In retrospect, good-to-great companies seemed to go through a sudden and dramatic transformation. The companies themselves, however, were often unaware they were even in the midst of changing at the time: their transformation had no defined slogan, launch event or change program.

Rather, their success was a sum of tiny, incremental pushes in the direction of their simple strategy, the Hedgehog concept.

New technology should be viewed only as an accelerator toward a goal, not as a goal itself.

Level 5 leaders drive successful transformations from good to great.

Level 5 leaders are not only excellent individuals, team members, managers and leaders, but also single-mindedly ambitious on behalf of the company. At the same time they remain humble. They are fanatically driven toward results, and want their company to continue performing even after they leave.

Far from being ego-driven, level 5 leaders are modest and understated. Level 5 leaders share the credit for their companyâ€™s achievements, downplaying their own role in them, but are quick to shoulder blame and responsibility for any shortcomings.

The right people in the right place are the foundation of greatness. The right people will eventually find a path to success.

The right people in the right place are the foundation of greatness.

Success requires confronting the nasty facts, while never losing faith.

Leaders must create an environment where the brutal facts are aired without hesitation.

Companies can make the leap from mediocrity to greatness by pursuing a simple strategic concept with the right leaders and people working in a culture of rigorous self-discipline.
