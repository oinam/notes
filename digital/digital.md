> Own your content, use eveything else as tools.

Physical devices should be entirely replaceable. We believe in owning our data, in spite of the “Cloud”. However, at-least one copy of every content lives somewhere online/backup where we can easily get it back when needed. The idea is to be able to __use any computer easily instead of one computer perfectly__.

[POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) -- Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere -- is the idea of owning your content on your own site. You can, then publish copies or sharing links to third parties such as social media with original post links to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your content.

We leverage the [Apple Ecosystem](/digital/apple/) to get things done. We do maintain backups of most options, so we can walk out of the ecosystem when needed. We will lose the seamlessness but things should still work.

We run most other services in the [Linux Ecosystem](/digital/linux/), while leaving the content part easily accessible across environments.
